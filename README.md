# denoising
This is a denoising pipeline, designed to evaluate the performance of various loss functions on medical image denoising.

## Installation

First, clone this repository onto your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/BojunLi03/denoising_project.git`

## Install dependencies

# Using the pipeline

To use the denoising pipeline, first provide it with a data file (the code assumes the file is named `data_file_name.h5` and is located in the same directory as the .ipynb and .py files). Once you have a data file (and have modified the `data_file_name` variable to be your data file's relative path), you may execute the notebook.

## User-defined Parameters

The pipeline, at the top of `denoising_pipeline.ipynb`, provides a number of user-defined parameters, including a learning rate parameter, as well as parameters for where to save trained models.
